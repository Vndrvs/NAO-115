# Nao-115 Poker Engine

* This is a work in progress poker engine written in C++.
* It will be modular and fast as lightning. 
* I'm aiming for reaching the MIT Pokerbots standard of 1000 hands / 30 seconds.

## Project goals

* Get and encode card data (preflop-river)
* Evaluate all hands and board states
* Implement CFR to support abstraction buckets and decision trees as well
* Add analysis and UI control tools

## Main principles

* Readable and commented code
* Builded step by step, from encoders to finished CFR based actions

## Styling and directory

* Currently, the structuring of the project is not a final version, I want to save time, therefore I'll finalize the hierarchy after several more modules are added.
* I'm trying to use CPP naming conventions, unless it hinders my proper understanding and / or ability to read the code

## License

* Please mind the proprietary license of the project which is specified inside the LICENSE file
